To install pam-utils, execute

python setup.py install

Example
=======

import pamutils.pam2nest as pam2nest
import pamutils.nest_vis as nest_vis

DELAY_FACTOR = 4.36

m = pam2nest.import_connections(EXPORT_PATH + 'hippocampus_full.zip')
    
nest_vis.printNeuronGroups(m)
nest_vis.printConnections(m)

weights = [9., 9., 9., 10., 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0]
ngs = pam2nest.CreateNetwork(m, 'izhikevich', weights, DELAY_FACTOR)
